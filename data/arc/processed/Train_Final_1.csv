B,cooling of flowing magma.,converging of crustal plates.,deposition of river sediments.,solution of carbonate minerals.,"Magma that intrudes between sedimentary rock layers. Any of the three main types of rocks (igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks) can melt into magma and cool into igneous rocks. Igneous and sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock as a result of intense heat from magma and pressure from burial within Earth. rocks that formed from cooling magma ocean. However, it does not seem likely that sedimentary rocks would be this hot very often, except near lava or magma flows. Any rock that forms from the cooling of magma is an igneous rock. Magma welled up into the surrounding sedimentary rock. Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock ); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse-grained. Magma cools and solidifies into rock. igneous- rocks formed from cooled magma such as granite. the magma cools and hardens into rock, and over time the forces that wear away earth such as flowing water, ice, or wind strip layers ove teh hardened magma and expose it. Sometimes this top layer, called the cap rock, is not sedimentary rock but is cooled and hardened lava that had spread out across the landscape in repeated flows from fissures or cracks in the ground. cooling and solidification of magma (molten rock). cooled, emplaced magma into preexisting rocks. Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. This rate of cooling is associated with the kind of magma flows. Rock solidified from a high temperature molten state; rock fromed by cooling magma. form as molten rock (magma) cools and solidifies. If the magma cools and hardens it will form into igneous rock. igneous rocks: formed by the cooling and hardening of magma (molten rock) from inside Earth.","along convergent plate boundaries, flat-lying sedimentary strata, tabular intrusions, and volcanic rocks are often bent into folds. At convergent plate boundaries where crustal rocks are buried deeply and experience high pressures and temperatures. Convergent plate boundary is the result of the temperature increase from the intrusion into the rock. The layers of sedimentary rock above the thrust plate are younger, dating to the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. The folded and thrust faulted igneous rocks, marine sedimentary rock and rocks that look like that of the ancient ocean floor, reveal that they got pushed up during plate collisions. crustal plate. by extensive folding and thrust faulting, that form at convergent plate. Curving section of an alpine chain occuring on a converging boundary between two crustal plates. Talc is a mineral that is most often found in the metamorphic rocks of convergent plate boundaries . When plates and the continents riding on them collide , the accumulated layers of rock may crumple and fold like a tablecloth that is pushed across a table , particularly if there is a mechanically weak basal layer such as salt . as undersea sedimentary rocks thrust up during shifting of tectonic plates. Fold mountains are formed when two tectonic plates move together -LRB- a convergent plate boundary -RRB- . most often associated with convergent plate boundaries. ancient crustal rock masses of the continents, largely igneous rock and metamorphic rock, and mostly of Precambrian age. two crustal plates move apart. Plate Convergence. Convergent plates. converging plate. Temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary . Plate tectonics provides an explanation for how rocks are recycled from igneous to sedimentary to metamorphic and back to igneous again.","Sedimentary rocks are deposited into layers. Erosion deposits thick layers of sediment, which eventually form sedimentary rocks. a layer of sedimentary rock that was formed as sediments of sand and mud were compressed into rock by overlying deposits. Many sedimentary rocks show distinct layering, which is the result of different types of sediment being deposited in succession. Sedimentary rocks result from compression of the layered sediments on the bottom of a large body of water. of beds, or layers, in sedimentary rocks and deposits. in a sediment or sedimentary rock during or after deposition. A sedimentary rock is a layered rock that is formed from the compaction, cementation, and the recrystallization of sediments. an earthquake or motion along a fault new deposits of sediment must build up on the eroded area folding of sedimentary rock layers a volcanic eruption... Sedimentary rocks are formed by sediment that is deposited over time, usually as layers at the bottom of lakes and oceans . These rock layers formed from sediments deposited in a lake. Sedimentary rock typically is layered, with the layers derived from different periods of sediment accumulation. Sedimentary rocks are formed in layers as sediments, usually on the bottom of the ocean. Sedimentary rock is formed as layers of sediment are pressed together and harden. Sedimentary rock is formed by the deposition of new layers over time. Sedimentary Rock : A rock formed from layers of particles, called sediments, that are cemented together under pressure. Sedimentation and Sedimentary Rocks. The deposited rocks build up in layers, called sediments. Ash layers from ancient volcanic eruptions are found in many sedimentary rock deposits. principle which states that sediments formed in ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way sediments are deposited today.","Sedimentary rock that forms when minerals crystallize from a solution. Category : Carbonate rocks Category : Minerals Category : Sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks contain a layer of iridium, a mineral uncommon on Earth. By the minerals in the sedimentary rock. It is very common in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and shale and is also present in variable amounts as an accessory mineral in most carbonate rocks . Sedimentary Rock- Is made up from pieces of rocks and minerals. Magnesite is mostly an evaporite mineral found in sedimentary rocks. sedimentary rocks: formed by the compaction and cementing of layers of sediment (rock fragments, plant and animal remains, minerals from water). Limestone is a sedimentary rock consisting primarily of calcium carbonate in the form of the mineral calcite. sedimentary rocks are precipitated from surface water solutions. carbon isotopes in sedimentary rocks. Most sedimentary rocks are held together by the minerals calcite and quartz, which act like a cement. Category : Carbonate rocks Category : Sedimentary rocks. Coal is a combustible sedimentary rock composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons . Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of the mineral calcite . Tufa: A terrestrial sedimentary rock which is formed by the precipitation of carbonate minerals from ambient temperature bodies of water. The mineral that forms these sedimentary rocks is feldspar. Substrate: A thin layer of mineral, often of calcium carbonate, underlying a mineral deposit, and separating it from the host rock. The ""layered"" or ""banded"" appearance resulting from mineral alignment in a metamorphic rock is termed:. They are usually derivatives of carbonate rocks, although they contain other minerals that result from reaction of the carbonates with associated siliceous detrital minerals that were present in the rock.",A fold observed in layers of sedimentary rock most likely resulted from the cooling of flowing magma.,A fold observed in layers of sedimentary rock most likely resulted from the converging of crustal plates.,A fold observed in layers of sedimentary rock most likely resulted from the deposition of river sediments.,A fold observed in layers of sedimentary rock most likely resulted from the solution of carbonate minerals.,Mercury_7233695,A fold observed in layers of sedimentary rock most likely resulted from the
